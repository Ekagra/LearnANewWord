# LearnANewWord_batch
Learn a new word and it's meaning everyday.

1) the batch file uses vb script to browse internet explorer and crawls http://www.wordthink.com/category/daily-word/ to look  for "word of the day"
2) then it crawls https://www.merriam-webster.com/ to search the definition of that word
3) then uses speach to speak the definition

#all the vb scripts are created and deployed from the batch file itself
